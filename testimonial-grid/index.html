            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
            enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and
            I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
            outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
            receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
